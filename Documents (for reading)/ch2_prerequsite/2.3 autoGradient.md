    Help on class GradientTape in module tensorflow.python.eager.backprop:
    
    class GradientTape(builtins.object)
     |  GradientTape(persistent=False, watch_accessed_variables=True)
     |  
     |  Record operations for automatic differentiation.
     |  
     |  Operations are recorded if they are executed within this context manager and
     |  at least one of their inputs is being "watched".
     |  
     |  Trainable variables (created by `tf.Variable` or `tf.compat.v1.get_variable`,
     |  where `trainable=True` is default in both cases) are automatically watched.
     |  Tensors can be manually watched by invoking the `watch` method on this context
     |  manager.
     |  
     |  For example, consider the function `y = x * x`. The gradient at `x = 3.0` can
     |  be computed as:
     |  
     |  ```python
     |  x = tf.constant(3.0)
     |  with tf.GradientTape() as g:
     |    g.watch(x)
     |    y = x * x
     |  dy_dx = g.gradient(y, x) # Will compute to 6.0
     |  ```
     |  
     |  GradientTapes can be nested to compute higher-order derivatives. For example,
     |  
     |  ```python
     |  x = tf.constant(3.0)
     |  with tf.GradientTape() as g:
     |    g.watch(x)
     |    with tf.GradientTape() as gg:
     |      gg.watch(x)
     |      y = x * x
     |    dy_dx = gg.gradient(y, x)     # Will compute to 6.0
     |  d2y_dx2 = g.gradient(dy_dx, x)  # Will compute to 2.0
     |  ```
     |  
     |  By default, the resources held by a GradientTape are released as soon as
     |  GradientTape.gradient() method is called. To compute multiple gradients over
     |  the same computation, create a persistent gradient tape. This allows multiple
     |  calls to the gradient() method as resources are released when the tape object
     |  is garbage collected. For example:
     |  
     |  ```python
     |  x = tf.constant(3.0)
     |  with tf.GradientTape(persistent=True) as g:
     |    g.watch(x)
     |    y = x * x
     |    z = y * y
     |  dz_dx = g.gradient(z, x)  # 108.0 (4*x^3 at x = 3)
     |  dy_dx = g.gradient(y, x)  # 6.0
     |  del g  # Drop the reference to the tape
     |  ```
     |  
     |  By default GradientTape will automatically watch any trainable variables that
     |  are accessed inside the context. If you want fine grained control over which
     |  variables are watched you can disable automatic tracking by passing
     |  `watch_accessed_variables=False` to the tape constructor:
     |  
     |  ```python
     |  with tf.GradientTape(watch_accessed_variables=False) as tape:
     |    tape.watch(variable_a)
     |    y = variable_a ** 2  # Gradients will be available for `variable_a`.
     |    z = variable_b ** 3  # No gradients will be available since `variable_b` is
     |                         # not being watched.
     |  ```
     |  
     |  Note that when using models you should ensure that your variables exist when
     |  using `watch_accessed_variables=False`. Otherwise it's quite easy to make your
     |  first iteration not have any gradients:
     |  
     |  ```python
     |  a = tf.keras.layers.Dense(32)
     |  b = tf.keras.layers.Dense(32)
     |  
     |  with tf.GradientTape(watch_accessed_variables=False) as tape:
     |    tape.watch(a.variables)  # Since `a.build` has not been called at this point
     |                             # `a.variables` will return an empty list and the
     |                             # tape will not be watching anything.
     |    result = b(a(inputs))
     |    tape.gradient(result, a.variables)  # The result of this computation will be
     |                                        # a list of `None`s since a's variables
     |                                        # are not being watched.
     |  ```
     |  
     |  Note that only tensors with real or complex dtypes are differentiable.

     |  __del__(self)
     |  
     |  __enter__(self)
     |      Enters a context inside which operations are recorded on this tape.
     |  
     |  __exit__(self, typ, value, traceback)
     |      Exits the recording context, no further operations are traced.
     |  
     |  __init__(self, persistent=False, watch_accessed_variables=True)
     |      Creates a new GradientTape.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |        persistent: Boolean controlling whether a persistent gradient tape
     |          is created. False by default, which means at most one call can
     |          be made to the gradient() method on this object.
     |        watch_accessed_variables: Boolean controlling whether the tape will
     |          automatically `watch` any (trainable) variables accessed while the tape
     |          is active. Defaults to True meaning gradients can be requested from any
     |          result computed in the tape derived from reading a trainable `Variable`.
     |          If False users must explicitly `watch` any `Variable`s they want to
     |          request gradients from.
     |  
     |  batch_jacobian(self, target, source, unconnected_gradients=<UnconnectedGradients.NONE: 'none'>, parallel_iterations=None, experimental_use_pfor=True)
     |      Computes and stacks per-example jacobians.
     |      
     |      See [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jacobian_matrix_and_determinant) for the
     |      definition of a Jacobian. This function is essentially an efficient
     |      implementation of the following:
     |      
     |      `tf.stack([self.jacobian(y[i], x[i]) for i in range(x.shape[0])])`.
     |      
     |      Note that compared to `GradientTape.jacobian` which computes gradient of
     |      each output value w.r.t each input value, this function is useful when
     |      `target[i,...]` is independent of `source[j,...]` for `j != i`. This
     |      assumption allows more efficient computation as compared to
     |      `GradientTape.jacobian`. The output, as well as intermediate activations,
     |      are lower dimensional and avoid a bunch of redundant zeros which would
     |      result in the jacobian computation given the independence assumption.
     |      
     |      Example usage:
     |      
     |      ```python
     |      with tf.GradientTape() as g:
     |        x = tf.constant([[1., 2.], [3., 4.]], dtype=tf.float32)
     |        g.watch(x)
     |        y = x * x
     |      batch_jacobian = g.batch_jacobian(y, x)
     |      # batch_jacobian is [[[2,  0], [0,  4]], [[6,  0], [0,  8]]]
     |      ```
     |      
     |      Args:
     |        target: A tensor with rank 2 or higher and with shape [b, y1, ..., y_n].
     |          `target[i,...]` should only depend on `source[i,...]`.
     |        source: A tensor with rank 2 or higher and with shape [b, x1, ..., x_m].
     |        unconnected_gradients: a value which can either hold 'none' or 'zero' and
     |          alters the value which will be returned if the target and sources are
     |          unconnected. The possible values and effects are detailed in
     |          'UnconnectedGradients' and it defaults to 'none'.
     |        parallel_iterations: A knob to control how many iterations are dispatched
     |          in parallel. This knob can be used to control the total memory usage.
     |        experimental_use_pfor: If true, uses pfor for computing the Jacobian. Else
     |          uses a tf.while_loop.
     |      
     |      Returns:
     |        A tensor `t` with shape [b, y_1, ..., y_n, x1, ..., x_m] where `t[i, ...]`
     |        is the jacobian of `target[i, ...]` w.r.t. `source[i, ...]`, i.e. stacked
     |        per-example jacobians.
     |      
     |      Raises:
     |        RuntimeError: If called on a non-persistent tape with eager execution
     |          enabled and without enabling experimental_use_pfor.
     |        ValueError: If vectorization of jacobian computation fails or if first

     |  
     |  gradient(self, target, sources, output_gradients=None, unconnected_gradients=<UnconnectedGradients.NONE: 'none'>)
     |      Computes the gradient using operations recorded in context of this tape.

     |      Args:
     |        target: Tensor (or list of tensors) to be differentiated.
     |        sources: a list or nested structure of Tensors or Variables. `target`
     |          will be differentiated against elements in `sources`.
     |        output_gradients: a list of gradients, one for each element of
     |          target. Defaults to None.
     |        unconnected_gradients: a value which can either hold 'none' or 'zero' and
     |          alters the value which will be returned if the target and sources are
     |          unconnected. The possible values and effects are detailed in
     |          'UnconnectedGradients' and it defaults to 'none'.
     |      
     |      Returns:
     |        a list or nested structure of Tensors (or IndexedSlices, or None),
     |        one for each element in `sources`. Returned structure is the same as
     |        the structure of `sources`.
     |      
     |      Raises:
     |        RuntimeError: if called inside the context of the tape, or if called more
     |         than once on a non-persistent tape.
     |        ValueError: if the target is a variable or if unconnected gradients is
     |         called with an unknown value.
     |  
     |  jacobian(self, target, sources, unconnected_gradients=<UnconnectedGradients.NONE: 'none'>, parallel_iterations=None, experimental_use_pfor=True)
     |      Computes the jacobian using operations recorded in context of this tape.

     |      See [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jacobian_matrix_and_determinant) for the
     |      definition of a Jacobian.
     |      
     |      Example usage:
     |      
     |      ```python
     |      with tf.GradientTape() as g:
     |        x  = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0])

     |      jacobian = g.jacobian(y, x)
     |      # jacobian value is [[2., 0.], [0., 4.]]
     |      ```
     |      
     |      Args:
     |        target: Tensor to be differentiated.
     |        sources: a list or nested structure of Tensors or Variables. `target`
     |          will be differentiated against elements in `sources`.
     |        unconnected_gradients: a value which can either hold 'none' or 'zero' and

     |          unconnected. The possible values and effects are detailed in
     |          'UnconnectedGradients' and it defaults to 'none'.
     |        parallel_iterations: A knob to control how many iterations are dispatched
     |          in parallel. This knob can be used to control the total memory usage.
     |        experimental_use_pfor: If true, vectorizes the jacobian computation. Else
     |          falls back to a sequential while_loop. Vectorization can sometimes fail
     |          or lead to excessive memory usage. This option can be used to disable

     |      
     |      Returns:
     |        A list or nested structure of Tensors (or None), one for each element in
     |        `sources`. Returned structure is the same as the structure of `sources`.
     |        Note if any gradient is sparse (IndexedSlices), jacobian function
     |        currently makes it dense and returns a Tensor instead. This may change in
     |        the future.
     |      
     |      
     |      Raises:
     |        RuntimeError: If called on a non-persistent tape with eager execution

     |  
     |  reset(self)
     |      Clears all information stored in this tape.
     |      
     |      Equivalent to exiting and reentering the tape context manager with a new
     |      tape. For example, the two following code blocks are equivalent:
     |      
     |      ```
     |      with tf.GradientTape() as t:
     |        loss = loss_fn()
     |      with tf.GradientTape() as t:
     |        loss += other_loss_fn()
     |      t.gradient(loss, ...)  # Only differentiates other_loss_fn, not loss_fn
     |      
     |      
     |      # The following is equivalent to the above
     |      with tf.GradientTape() as t:
     |        loss = loss_fn()
     |        t.reset()
     |        loss += other_loss_fn()
     |      t.gradient(loss, ...)  # Only differentiates other_loss_fn, not loss_fn
     |      ```
     |      
     |      This is useful if you don't want to exit the context manager for the tape,
     |      or can't because the desired reset point is inside a control flow construct:
     |      
     |      ```
     |      with tf.GradientTape() as t:
     |        loss = ...
     |        if loss > k:
     |          t.reset()
     |      ```
     |  
     |  stop_recording(self)
     |      Temporarily stops recording operations on this tape.
     |      
     |      Operations executed while this context manager is active will not be
     |      recorded on the tape. This is useful for reducing the memory used by tracing
     |      all computations.
     |      
     |      For example:
     |      
     |      ```
     |        with tf.GradientTape(persistent=True) as t:
     |          loss = compute_loss(model)
     |          with t.stop_recording():
     |            # The gradient computation below is not traced, saving memory.
     |            grads = t.gradient(loss, model.variables)
     |      ```
     |      
     |      Yields:
     |        None
     |      Raises:
     |        RuntimeError: if the tape is not currently recording.
     |  
     |  watch(self, tensor)
     |      Ensures that `tensor` is being traced by this tape.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |        tensor: a Tensor or list of Tensors.
     |      
     |      Raises:
     |        ValueError: if it encounters something that is not a tensor.
     |  
     |  watched_variables(self)
     |      Returns variables watched by this tape in order of construction.
